/* Activity 5
 * 
 * A Caesar Cipher takes a message, and shifts every letter in the same amount. For example, "holy"
 * shifted 23 gives a message of "eliv" after moving every letter down 23 spaces.
 *
 * 1.
 * We chose to implement this because it's not too hard and the concept is similar to finding sentiment
 * values for every word. 
 *
 * 2.
 * The main problem in this program is finding what letter to replace the old letter. We got the idea to
 * put the alphabet into a string, and using indexOf to find the "numerical value" of every letter in the
 * initial message (a -> 1, b -> 2... ). To allow capitalized letter to also get shifted, we made a second
 * string with all the capital letters and combined that with the LetterNumber because the letters would
 * maintain the same numerical value.
 *
 * 3.
 * public static String
 * There needed to be a message and the change to that message, which is a string and an int required as
 * parameters. The method needs to be static to work with the main method.
