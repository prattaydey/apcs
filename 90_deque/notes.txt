DISCOS:
- In a deque, you can both enqueue and dequeue at either end.
- Many of dequeue's methods have a version that throws an exception when the list is empty, while the other returns null.

QCCs:
- If a deque can both enqueue and dequeue at either end, how is still considered a "queue" considering it does not follow FIFO?
