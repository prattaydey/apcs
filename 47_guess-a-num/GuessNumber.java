 * class GuessNumber -- fun fun fun!
 *
 * SKELETON
 *
 * eg, sample interaction with end user:
 *
 * Guess a # fr 1-100: 50
 * Too high
 * Guess a # fr 1-49: 25
 * Too low
 * Guess a # fr 26-49: 38
 * Correct! It took 3 guesses
 ***/

/***
    DISCO:
    - You can simply make a while loop run forever by putting (true) in the condition statement.

    QCC:
    - Is there a better way of choosing a random integer within a range of values?
