ACTIVITY 1
1a) public static double sentimentVal
1b) Yes, it requires a String parameter. If you pass a different parameter there will be an error.
1c) The method returns a double value.

2)
sentimentVal(appalling):  0.0
sentimentVal(neutral): 0.03
sentimentVal(good): 0.0
sentimentVal(terrific): 2.39

3a) It would compile because sentimentVal returns a double and num is initialized as a double variable.
3b) This would not compile because sentimentVal returns a double, not a String.
3c) This would not compile because sentimentVal only takes one parameter each call.


ACTIVITY 2
4) totalSentiment isolates each word in a string by first finding the index of the spaces between words, and then using substring to isolate that word. We take the sentimentVal of the word, and then use a while loop to iterate over each word in the string.

5a) Yes, the star ratings do make sense according to the review.
