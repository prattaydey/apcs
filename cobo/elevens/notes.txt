--------Activity 2--------
1. A deck is an ArrayList that can contain data of the object type card.
2. There would be six cards, because you multiply the number of suits with the number of ranks to get the possible amount of unique cards.
3.
    String[] ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"}
    String[] suits = {"diamonds", "clubs", "hearts", "spades"}
    int[] pointValues = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
4. They do matter, based on the method we used for creating cards, which was looping through the arrays at the same index.
That means that ranks in the beginning should correspond to their value. For example, 2 in the beginning gets a value of 2, while a ace in the end gets a value of 11.

--------Activity 3--------
1.
  public static String flip() {
    if ((int) Math.random() * 3 > 1){
    return "heads";
    }
    else{
    return "tails";
    }
  }
  1, 2, or 3 is generated. If it's 1, it's tails, otherwise, it's heads.
