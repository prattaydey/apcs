Binary to decimal conversion:
1. Take the leftmost digit of the given binary code and multiply it by 2. 
2. Then add the next digit (right of the original) to the product. 
3. Continue this process by multiplying the sum by 2 and add the proceeding digit again. Repeat until you reach the end of the binary code. 
4. The last sum will be your decimal value.

Decimal to binary conversion:
1. Take the decimal number and repeatedly divide it by 2. Since the remainder of division by 2 is always either 1 or 0, we can use these remainders to convert to a binary number. 
2. Take the remainders in order and that will be your binary code from left to right.
