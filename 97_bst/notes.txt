DISCOS:
- We realized our earlier code from the previous hws could have been implemented in a much more readable and presentable way if we employed boolean helper methods such as isLeaf and avoided long conditional statements when not necessary.
- When removing a node with 2 subtrees, you can either replace it with the max value of its left subtree or the min value of its right subtree.

QCCs:
- Is there a more efficient way to implement remove, using more recursion?
