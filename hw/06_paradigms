HW06 -- Hello World
2021-09-28

Scheme: 
(display "Hello, world!")

NetLogo:
to function
  print "Hello, world!"
end

Python:
  print("Hello, world!")
 
SIMILARITIES: 
- All need a keyword such as display or print in order for it to present the text
- The text intended to print is in quotation marks as a string

DIFFERENCES:
- NetLogo requires an end statement to the function, while the others do not
- On Scheme, instead of using the keyword "print" you instead use "display" for the same purpose.
