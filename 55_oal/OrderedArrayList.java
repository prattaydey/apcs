/*
DISCO:
- get(), size(), toString() and constructor methods don't have best/worst cases, as their functions do not differ in any way given any number of elements in a list.
- Because we want out list to be ordered, methods like add and set require us to iterate through the list an extra time time to ensure ascending order.
QCC:
- How can we optimize set() so its runtime complexity is O(1) (that is, removing the add and remove methods)? Are they necessary for setting a value at an index?

  Best case: Changing last element to value that still greater than all other values.
  Runtime Complexity: O(n)
  Why?
  By changing the last element in this manner, we are only iterating through the dataset
  once. First removing the last element does not require a shift in indices, and then adding
  a new value that still maintains sortedness only results in one iteration, as no shifting
  in indices is made.

  Worst case: Changing first element to a value that is still less than all other values.
  Runtime Complexity: O(n)
  Why?
  By changing the first element in this manner, we are iterating through the dataset 3 times.
  Removing the first element results in a shift in indices of all other elements one down, and
  then another iteration is made to find the position to add the new value in. The third iteration
  is made in shifting all proceeding elements one index up.

  Best case: There is enough empty indices within the array for all the data. The value
             being added is larger than all the other elements in the dataset.
  Runtime Complexity: O(n)
  Why?
  Since order matters, the list is iterated through before adding newVal in the proper index.
  The value being larger than all other elements does not result in a shift of index for other
  elements in the dataset.

  Worst case: Array has to be expanded in order to accomodate newly added value. The value
              being added is less than all the other elements in the dataset.
  Runtime Complexity: O(n)
  Why?
  List is iterated through the first time with order in mind. If we need to expand the array,
  we iterate through the ordered array again. On top of that, if the value being added is less
  than all the other elements in the dataset, it results in a shift of one index up for all other
  elements in the dataset.
