/*
DISCO
- Interfaces basically work as "checklists", making sure a class has certain methods or instance variables before being allowed to compile and run.
- Abstract objects cannot be instantiated.
QCC
- What is the point of interfaces? Can't you use inheritance as a way to make sure certain methods/variables exist?
