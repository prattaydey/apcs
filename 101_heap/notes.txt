DISCOS:
- Our algo for heap removal was very similar to that of a BST, as we did essentially the same thing for the 3 different cases.


QCCs:
- When would we use heaps?
- Our group wasn't sure what to do when removing a key value that is found in two nodes. We considered removing the node that is the shortest distance away from the root.
