ACTIVITY 1
1a) public static double sentimentVal
1b) Yes, it requires a String parameter. If you pass a different parameter there will be an error.
1c) The method returns a double value.

2)
sentimentVal(appalling):  0.0
sentimentVal(neutral): 0.03
sentimentVal(good): 0.0
sentimentVal(terrific): 2.39

3a) It would compile because sentimentVal returns a double and num is initialized as a double variable.
3b) This would not compile because sentimentVal returns a double, not a String.
3c) This would not compile because sentimentVal only takes one parameter each call.


ACTIVITY 2
4) totalSentiment isolates each word in a string by first finding the index of the spaces between words, and then using substring to isolate that word. We take the sentimentVal of the word, and then use a while loop to iterate over each word in the string.

5a) Yes, the star ratings do make sense according to the review. Reviews with generally bad sentiment get low stars, and vice versa.
5b) Two ways in which totalSentiment can be adjusted so it returns even more reasonable ratings is taking into account a broader range of vocabulary. Also, instead of looking at words one by one, it could consider the context.

6a) The student's code returns a 0 star rating for any review that has a totalSentiment of over 15. Generally, a totalSentiment of over 15 should imply that it was very positive and return a high star value such as 5 stars.
6b) The student can fix their code by changing the else statement to return 5 stars instead of 0. Or, if the student desires to keep the 0-4 scale, they can change the else statement to return 4 and decrement the other return values by 1.


ACTIVITY 3
3) indexOf returns the first occurrence of an input in a string, or -1 if the input is not found in the string at all. Substring returns a spliced string, taking the first input as its starting index and the second input as its end index (exclusive). It is sometimes necessary to add 1 to the position of the space when copying the remainder of the string because as the first input in substring is inclusive, we don't want to copy a character that was already included in the first half of the string.

5) Calling a non static method requires first the initialization of an Object that calls the method. A static method does not require an Object.

6) It could take a review and replace adjectives with either positive or negative adjectives to change the total sentiment of the review.


ACTIVITY 4
1) Competitors in the same business or consumers who had their own bad experience may autogenerate negative reviews to lower competition or even drive one out of business.

2) Owners or acquaintances of a business may autogenerate reviews to inflate the prestige of their business and attract new consumers based on false experiences.

3) - Iterate over each word in a review using while loop conditions: review.length() > 0 and review.indexOf(" ") > -1
   - If the word contains "*", identify the sentiment value of it (negative, neutral, positive) & change it to the opposite.
   - Add the word to the new, fake review string and remove it from the original review.
   - Repeat and move onto next word until while loop ends.

5) It removes the first character from oneWord and updates the oneWord variable accordingly.

6) The "*" and other punctuation would interfere with matching the word to its corresponding value in cleanSentiment.csv, as that file does not take punctuation into account.

7) Change adjectives to only those that have a very high sentiment value or go even further to change things other than adjectives.


ACTIVITY 5
