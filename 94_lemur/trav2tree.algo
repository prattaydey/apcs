HOW KEEN ARE YOUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION?
------------------------------------------------
Q: For a given binary tree, how many unique pre-order traversals are there?
A: One

Q: For a given binary tree, how many unique in-order traversals are there?
A: One

Q: For a given binary tree, how many unique post-order traversals are there?
A: One

Q: For a given traversal, how many unique trees could have produced it?
A: An infinite number of trees can be produced from only one transversal, with no other information given about it. 

Q: Given a pre-order traversal, what can you infer about its tree?
A: The first node is the root node

Q: Given a post-order traversal, what can you infer about its tree?
A: The last node is the root node. 

Q: What does "1-to-1" mean?
A: There is a linear relationship between 2 things.

Q: What does "onto" mean?
A: Our group was not sure, but TAK on Piazza said that "onto" is in reference to graphs, a function that maps A to B is considered to be "onto" if every element of B corresponds to at least one element of A. This is not the same as one-to-one because in an onto function, multiple elements of A may be mapped to the same element of B.Â

ALGO for PRE-ORDER & IN-ORDER
------------------------------------------------
givens: a pre-order and in-order transversal for a binary tree

procedure:
1. Identify the root node as the first node in the pre-order transversal.
2. Locate the root node in the in-order transversal, partition to the left and right of it as the subtrees.
