/*
DISCO:
There are many ways to code the same thing, all of which are correct
QCC:
How do we know which is the best code for the job?
Which takes the computer the least computations?
ALGO:
For both GCDER and GCDEW, we work on working a and b down to the same number by using the rule thatthe GCD of 2 numbers remains the same if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.
